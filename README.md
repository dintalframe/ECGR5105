Course Overview and Objectives
Machine learning is a sub-field of Artificial Intelligence that allows computers to learn and/or act without being explicitly programmed. This course introduces machine learning principles and provides foundations for a data-driven approach to machine intelligence and decision-making. The topics include various supervised and unsupervised learning approaches (including deep learning), optimization procedures, and statistical inference. During this course, the students will digest and practice their knowledge and skills by class discussion, homework and exams, as well as obtain in-depth experience with a particular topic through a final project.

Final project 

Final project is conducted independently or collaboratively as a team. The project presentation, report and codes should be all submitted via Canvas.  

It's important that you work on a real machine learning project, or a real problem in some relevant domain, so that you earn first-hand experience. The instructor will provide a few sample project topics/ideas. The instructor is available to discuss and shape the project. By the end of the semester, you should submit your code and data for this project, write a project report, and prepare a class presentation.

Specific for Graduate Students: The graduate students will be obligated to submit one additional homework assignment. Also, the final project reequipment and standard is higher for them.

Academic Honesty
Plagiarism, cheating, and any form of unauthorized collaboration will not be tolerated and will be handled in accordance with University policies described in the Student Handbook.  You are expected to be familiar with the University's policies about academic honesty: The Code of Student Academic IntegrityLinks to an external site..

 

Although students are encouraged to discuss some homework assignments and work together to develop a deeper understanding of the topics presented in this course, submission of others’ work, efforts, or ideas as your own is not permitted. Each student is expected to prepare and submit his/her own programs, reports, drawings, and other materials unless otherwise designated.

Copying and sharing of student work such as computer files, documents, spreadsheets, or drawings is not allowed. If multiple students’ work is suspiciously similar, a penalty may be assessed to all students involved. If a situation arises in which you are uncertain whether cooperation with another student would constitute cheating or some other violation of the honor code, please ask the instructor for guidance and clarification of these rules. Any evidence of cheating will be referred to the Office of Student Conduct. 

 

Enjoy the course!
